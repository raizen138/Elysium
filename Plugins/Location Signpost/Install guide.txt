Place the Maps folder inside the Graphics folder of your game.

Put the script inside Script.txt in a new section above Main.

You're pretty much set; it will show a default image if the map does not
contain "Route", "Town", "Lake", "Cave" or "City".

If you want to add other images, just go this part of the script:

if $game_map.name.include?("Route")
   @sprites["Image"].bitmap = Bitmap.new("Graphics/Maps/Route_1")

and add another "elsif" statement right below it, like this:

elsif $game_map.name.include?("PLACEHOLDER_NAME")
   @sprites["Image"].bitmap = Bitmap.new("Graphics/Maps/PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE")

and replace PLACEHOLDER_NAME with the name of your map, and
PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE with the name of the image you want to show.
The image HAS to be located in the Maps folder.
